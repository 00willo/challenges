# PyBites Challenges

Every Monday we release a challenge [on our blog](http://pybit.es).

If this is your first time around, clone this repo: 

	$ git clone https://github.com/pybites/challenges.git pybites_challenges && cd $_

After that you can pull the exercise branch with:

	$ git pull origin ch<sequence>_exercise
	# I will use ch01_exercise for this example

Checkout the new branch:

	$ git checkout ch01_exercise

Branch off your solution:

	$ git checkout -b ch01_exercise_<github_user>

If you want to submit the solution do a pull request:

	$ git request-pull (#TODO)
